##RUNTIME

Each program folder contains a makefile which allow easy compiling and testing the alogorithms.The are different for OpenMp ,serial and MPI
1. open makefile 
2. Run the first command for the main C file
3. Run the second command 
4. Run the output file 
5. observe the output

##Serial Folder- contains the serial program.

In order to select the different Ciphers provided , need to comment out the cipher which is not required at the time and reverse the same for the other cipher.
To run the forward and backward search alogorithm , comment out the forward and uncomment the backward , then repeat the same steps for each cipher provied .

For the cipher1 backward search will more faster when compared to the forwared vector search and for the cipher2 forward search is faster while comparing the backward .

##OpenMP Folder- contains the OpenMP program.

In order to select the different Ciphers provided , need to comment out the cipher which is not required at the time and reverse the same for the other cipher.
To run the forward and backward search alogorithm , comment out the forward and uncomment the backward , then repeat the same steps for each cipher provied .

For the cipher1 backward search will more faster when compared to the forwared vector search and for the cipher2 forward search is faster while comparing the backward .
